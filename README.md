Clock Exercises
1. core.wait is pretty precise, it's consistently accurate to  0.001 seconds
2. using a core.clock to time a while loop is about as accurate as the core.wait. it flips to the next image once the clock reaches 2 seconds, but the clock will sometimes go over by a few 0.001 seconds.
3. Sometimes this goes into -0.01 seconds

Frame-Based

2: between 24 and 110 frames were dropped each trial. clock based is better for me. Also i got warnings about dropped frames.
